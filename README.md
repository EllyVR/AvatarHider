# Disclaimer
VRChat does **not** condone the use of mods, and, if found to be modifying the client, then you **will** be punished.

**That being said,** there is no anticheat of any sort (file integrity check, position check, etc.) placed on the client.
The only anticheat (if it could be called that) in VRChat is an API limiter, and Photon checks, and the mods listed in this repository, will not trigger any of those.
The real only way to get punished on this game is to piss of the aforementioned anticheats, or be reported by a user with video evidence of you using a mod (whether this be you flying or verbally admitting you mod the game).

So just, stay safe, and don't be stupid and run around saying you use mods, and you'll be a-ok.

Also, for my sake, **I am not responsible for any bans using my mods may cause**.
